# 🌸 PRODIGY_WD_01 – Responsive Landing Page

This repository contains my submission for *Task 1* of the *Web Development Internship* at *Prodigy InfoTech*.

My task was to create a *Responsive Landing Page* — and I designed a cute, pastel-themed website for the *Tiny Tykes Clay Workshop*. It includes animated elements, a countdown timer, interactive gallery, registration form, and much more.
